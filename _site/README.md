# Personal Webpage Template for Chen's Personal Tutees



- This  template is made by [Yet Another Legal Academic (YALA)](https://icaruszhu.github.io/) for my personal tutees at Birmingham Law School. Please feel free to download, fork, change, or do whatever you want with it to suit your own need.  It is licensed under the hugely permissive MIT License.

- You can delete this README.md page later if you wish. 

- Personally, I like [the Architect theme] (https://github.com/pages-themes/architect) (CC-0 licensed) a lot, but you can choose other themes fit your aesthetic preference. Remember everything is customisable.
