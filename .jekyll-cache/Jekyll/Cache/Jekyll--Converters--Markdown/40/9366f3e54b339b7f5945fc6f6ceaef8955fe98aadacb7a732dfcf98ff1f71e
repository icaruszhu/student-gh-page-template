<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This  template is made by <a href="https://icaruszhu.github.io/">Yet Another Legal Academic (YALA)</a> initially for my personal tutees at Birmingham Law School. However, it can be used outside this small context and that’s why decide to publish it.  Please feel free to download, fork, alter, remix, or do whatever you want with the repo template to suit your own need. It is licensed under the permissive MIT License.</p>

    <p>You can delete this README.md page later if you wish.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Personally, I like the <a href="https://github.com/pages-themes/architect">Architect theme</a>  for its elegant simplicity. The theme is licensed under the CC-0. You can choose other themes that fit your aesthetic preference better. Remember almost everything in this repo is customisable.</p>

<h1 id="download-this-repo">Download this repo</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>using your favourite command line terminal with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git clone https://github.com/icaruszhu/student-gh-page-template.git</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>alternatively, you can use the old-fashioned method by hitting the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">download</code> button</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="modification-for-a-quick-start">Modification for a quick start</h1>
<p>There are two files in the repo you need to personalise in order to create your own site. I use some placeholder words such as the fictitious student name “Tem Plate” and the fabled “University of Rashomon “.  Please do change them as they only exist in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meinong%27s_jungle">Meinong’s jungle</a>:-)</p>

<h2 id="indexmd"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.md</code></h2>
<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.md</code> is the file where your CV live. You can add information such as your background, education, experience, award, hobby, aspiration etc.</p>

<h2 id="_configyml"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code></h2>
<p>You definite need to modify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>`, especially these two places:</p>
<div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Tem Plate</span>   <span class="c1"># put your name to replace "Tem Plate</span>
<span class="na">description</span><span class="pi">:</span>  <span class="s">Law Student @ Birmingham Law School</span> <span class="c1"># you can change this line as well</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>I have put some comments after the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code> symbol and they are self-explanatory.</p>

<h2 id="more-modification">More modification</h2>

<p>There are a lot more you can customise. For example, you can change layout files and those <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">css</code> files, but they can left alone for the time being. You may want to change them at some point when you feel a bit adventurous.</p>

<h1 id="create-your-gh-pages">Create your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code></h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, you will need to create your site to be hosted by github pages. You can have a domain name  with your github <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UserName</code>, i.e., [UserName].github.io. The guide https://guides.github.com/features/pages/ provides a detailed guide.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternatively, you can also store your personal site as a normal git project and then create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code>  branch to host html contents.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Either way, you can simply copy and paste everything in this template repo into your local directory or folder where you wish your personal site files to live.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="next-step-when-you-become-a-more-advanced-user-">Next step: when you become a more advanced user …</h1>

<p>There are a lot more you can do with your static personal site. For example, you may wish to learn to use Jekyll to build your personal website locally on your laptop. Jekyll also allows to install plug-ins to have some more features.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that many third-party jekyll plug-ins are not supported by Github pages. For example,  one of my favorite plugins <a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar">Jekyll-Scholar</a> is not supported by gh-pages by default. I need to build my site locally and  need to use jekyll to locally and need to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git subtree</code> to push html contents to the remote branch. However, you do not have to worry about this for the time being. The out-of-the-box features of gh-pages are more than sufficient for building a static personal site remotely.</p>

<p>Of course, you may also wish to learn ~git~ <a href="https://git-scm.com/">version control</a> in order to get to the bottom of what is ultimately going on. You can find local software carpentry workshops that teach <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> and plenty of online tutorials.</p>
